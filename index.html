          <p>Remember, the keys to building a more visually inclusive Web are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Don't use only colors for visual advertisements, because not all
              uses with understand the message
            </li>
            <li>
              Use different contrast colors and indicators (like an X for exit)
              for users with problems differentiating colors
            </li>
            <li>
              Using contrast so our text and colors provide better visual cues
            </li>
            <li>Using correct font size so our content is legible</li>

              between the red and green colors.

            <li>blue-yellow, where the blues tend to appear greener</li>

        <h3>Accesibility about HTML</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Using semantic HTML elements whenever possible (such as header
            instead of a div with an id="header") will allow screen reader users
            to navigate your website more efficiently.
          </li>
          <li>
            The role attribute is used to communicate information about the role
            of specific elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            role="presentation" allows a screen reader to skip markup elements
            that don't directly contain useful information.
          </li>
          <li>
            aria-label and other ARIA properties can be used to help users
            perceive information that is communicated visually but not through
            text.
          </li>
          <li>
            The alt attribute should be added to every image element (and all
            other elements that support it) instead of aria-label. When used,
            its value should be a useful description of the image.
          </li>

          <h2>Color schemes</h2>
          <p>
            Most users skim websites, they will not read every word and checking
            every menu, you need to guide the user to the most important content
            with good color choices.
          </p>

          <section>
            <h3>Triadic color scheme</h3>
            <p>
              Provides a sense of equality, vibrancy, and security in your
              designs.
            </p>

            <p>
              If we stick with blue being our main color, we would then select
              red-orange and yellow-green as the pairing combinations. This
              creates a triangle of colors within the color wheel and gives us a
              wider palette to choose from.
            </p>

          <section>
            <h3>Analogous color scheme</h3>
            <p>Low-contrast experience</p>
            <p>Color schemes create a visually pleasing and calming display.</p>
            <p>
              They shouldn't be used for content that needs the user's direct
              attention, but they can be used to create backgrounds that do not
              compete with the main content of the site.

            <h3>Complementary color scheme</h3>

            <p>
              Complementary color palettes are very common in logos and
              uniforms.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, when used strategically, they can draw attention to
              certain elements on the page that you want users to focus on.

            <h3>Monochromatic</h3>

            <p>
              A single color with varying shades and tints to create a
              monochromatic palette.
            </p>
            <p>
              The use of a single color can provide an immediate sense of
              harmony.

          <h3>Cool colors and Warm colors</h3>
          <p>Colors can be clasified in cool colors or warm colors</p>

          <section>
            <h3>Cool colors</h3>
            <p>
              Cool colors are given this designation because of their calming,
              soothing nature. They’re often associated with winter climates or
              water.
            </p>
            <p>
              These colors range between blue, purple and green. Most gray
              colors fall into the cool category as well.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>Warm colors</h3>
            <p>
              Warm colors range between red and yellow, which include various
              versions of those colors in addition to orange. This also
              comprises colors such as brown and tan. These are considered to be
              “warm” colors in that they evoke a sense of warmth. For instance,
              fire is associated with warmth, and it typically burns between the
              spectrum of reds and yellows. Warm colors can also promote a
              feeling of aggression and are considered bold.

            <h2>Optimal form of setting color in websites</h2>
            <p>There are different ways of setting colors in CSS, those are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Keyword: example, yellow</li>
              <li>Hex Code: example, #fff</li>
              <li>RGB: example, rgb(23, 45, 23)</li>
              <li>HSLA: example, hsla(34, 100%, 50%, 0.1)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>But the HSLA is the best and the most semantic, this is why:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The CSS color keywords only give us a few options.</li>
              <li>
                Hex Codes and RGB values cannot be intuitively adjusted. For
                example, you get feedback on your design that one color needs to
                be a little brighter, that does not translate to intuitive
                changes within Hexadecimal codes or RGB values.
              </li>
              <li>
                HSLA is the most semantic system of setting colors with CSS.
              </li>
              <li>Let you control the contrast and the color scheme better</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Use of the HSLA:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The “pure” color is set with the Hue. This is expressed as the
                angle in degrees around the color wheel.
              </li>
              <li>
                Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of that hue. Colors
                with full saturation (100%) are the color itself, colors with no
                saturation (0%) are completely grayscale.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lightness refers to the lightness of the color. 0% is black,
                100% is white.
              </li>
              <li>
                A, or alpha, refers to the opacity. 0% is fully transparent,
                100% is fully opaque.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Best practices about colors</h2>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Use neon colors sparingly.</strong> While the use of
                neon colors can feel hip, they are often hard on a user's eyes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Avoid vibrating colors.</strong> Vibrating colors result
                from pairing two colors with high saturation together that may
                be complementary to one another. It creates a glowing or moving
                effect, which also can be hard on one's eyes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Use backdrops to separate vibrating colors.</strong> In
                the example, the white backdrop behind the green card reduces
                the space where the contrasting colors (red and green) are
                directly next to each other, but the overall effect is still too
                intense for most websites.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong
                  >Avoid color combinations with insufficient contrast,</strong
                >
                including:
                <ul>
                  <li>Bright colors on top of bright colors</li>
                  <li>Light colors on top of light colors</li>
                  <li>Dark colors on top of dark colors</li>
                </ul>
